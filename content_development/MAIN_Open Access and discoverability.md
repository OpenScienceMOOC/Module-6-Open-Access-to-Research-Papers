## Open Access and discoverability <a name="discoverability"></a>

Google Scholar is probably pretty much every researcher's go to choice for academic search engine. And while it does a pretty good job of letting you know if you have access to a PDF or not, what it often does not tell you is whether these articles are in violation of copyright or not.

Open Access, true OA, articles do not violate copyright. And they can be more easily discoveed and re-used as part of this.

There are now a cool array of what we might call 'open discovery engines' that help you to discover OA content amidst the millions of articles out there.

For example, [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/) provides a visal network-like interface integrated with BASE (all disciplines) and PubMed (life sciences).

Other alternative discovery platforms include [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/), which we discuss more in the section on scholarly collaboration platforms too.
