## Painting a global picture of Open Access <a name="global"></a>

Open Access is everywhere, in virtually every country around the world. Even [UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/ERI/pdf/oa_policy_rev2.pdf) have an Open Access policy, quoting:

> Equal access to science is not only a social and ethical requirement for human development, but also essential for realizing the full potential of scientific communities worldwide and for orienting scientific progress towards meeting the needs of humankind.‚Äù (The World Conference on Science, 1999, held under the auspices of UNESCO and ICSU)

The global landscape is incredibly complex and heterogeneous. Here, we will show some examples to help illustrate the current state around the world.

[insert continental_OA figure from Chilwa and Sife]

### Africa

In Africa, more than 1 million OA articles are currently available in repositories from the top 22 countries ([Chilwa and Sife, 2017](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Chilwa%20and%20Sife%2C%202017.pdf)). Despite its large size, the African continent had only 4.52% of the OA repositories and 0.14% of documents in the OpenDOAR.

African Journals OnLine (AJOL) is the world's largest and preeminent collection of peer-reviewed, African-published scholarly journals. 215 journals out of 521 hosted at AJOL are open access with 75,938 full text articles for download ([Kuchma, 2018](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Kuchma%2C%202018.pdf)).

National initiatives include the [Algerian Scientific Journal Platform](https://www.asjp.cerist.dz/) (ASJP), an electronic publishing platform for Algerian scientific journals developed and managed by the [Research Centre on Scientific and Technical Information](http://cerist.dz/index.php/en/) (CERIST).

### Asia

Regional initiatives include [Nepal Journals Online](https://www.nepjol.info/) (NepJOL) is a service to provide access to Nepalese published research, and increase worldwide knowledge of indigenous scholarship. It covers the full range of academic disciplines and provides full text access to more than 17,000 journal articles.

In the Middle East, [Lujano and Khalifa, 2018](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Lujano%20and%20Khalifa%2C%202018.pdf) found that "APCs and submission charges is growing trend in low economic countries, for example: Egypt, Sudan, North Africa States, however in high economic countries
like Gulf States the authors get paid when publish a paper in a journal."


### Australia and Pacfic

### Europe


### South America

The last 20 years have seen a number of successful initiatives launched in Latin America. This includes the [Latin American Council of Social Sciences](https://www.clacso.org/) (CLASCO), which publishes 'diamond OA' journals, supports repositories, and helps develop OA policies at the institutional and national levels. CLASCO collaborates with the [Scientific Electronic Library Online](https://scielo.org/en) (SciELO), a successful cooperative decentralized platform for electronic publishing of OA scholarly journals.

A recent study by [Lujano and Khalifa, 2018](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Lujano%20and%20Khalifa%2C%202018.pdf) found that only 5% of journals in Latin America charge either APCs or submission charges. The vast majority of OA publications are publicly funded, thanks to initiatives like those above. Latin American journals in DOAJ represent 19% of total amount of journals indexed by June 2018.


### North America



While the overall state of the scholarly publishing industry is dominated by major western publishing houses, there are a number of high-level international collaborations that challenge this [oligopolistic landscape](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502).

For example:

* [**SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online)**](https://scielo.org/en): A comprehensive approach to full OA journal publishing, involving a number of Latin American countries.

* [**Bioline International**](http://www.bioline.org.br/): A non-profit organization dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries; a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil.

* [**RePEC (Research Papers in Economics)**](http://repec.org/): A collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 101 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related sciences.

* [**Public Knowledge Project**](https://pkp.sfu.ca/): Developed the open-source publishing software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which is now in use around the world.

* [**African Journals Online (AJOL)**](https://www.ajol.info/): AJOL partners with hundreds of journals from all over the African continent, so that African-origin research output is available to Africans and to the rest of the world.

* [**REDALYC**](http://www.redalyc.org/home.oa): A bibliographic database and a digital library of OA journals, supported by the Universidad Aut?noma del Estado de M?xico with the help of numerous other higher education institutions and information systems.

* [**LA Referencia**](http://www.lareferencia.info/en/): A platform that gives visibility to the scientific production of higher education and research institutions in Latin America, promotes open and free access to the full text, with special emphasis on publicly financed results.

### Other valuable resources

* SPARC have a [database](http://researchsharing.sparcopen.org/) that documents U.S. federal funder requirements for sharing of research articles and data.

* The [ROARMAP](https://roarmap.eprints.org/) database charting the international growth of OA policies and mandates.
