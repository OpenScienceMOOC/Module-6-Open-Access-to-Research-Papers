## Open Access platforms <a name="OAplatforms"></a>

There are a number of different types of platforms or databases when it comes to OA. These can be for articles, metadata, datasets themselves, or journals. In fact, there is a complex ecosystem of platforms out there - some overlap, some integrate, some are stand-alone. This forms a generally confusing infrastructure around OA and scholarly publishing in general.

The main databases for OA articles and journals are the Directory of Open Access Journals ([DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)) and PubMed Central [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/). In the case of DOAJ, only fully "gold" OA journals are included, whereas PMC also hosts articles from hybrid journals.
