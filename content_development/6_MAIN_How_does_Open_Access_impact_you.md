## How does Open Access impact you <a name="impact"></a>

There is a direct link between Open Access and you through the additional research impact it generates. Conceptually, it is hopefully not difficult to see that if more people can access and use something, that makes it more impactful.

While there is a clear ethical and more case for OA, communicating the personal impact it can have on individuals helps to leverage intrinsic motivations for researchers. As in, there has to be something in it for them. Thankfully, there is a strong almost universal case for an impact advantage for researchers who choose to publish OA.

For example, a traditional measure of research impact is the number of citations and article receives. [Most studies](https://www.scienceopen.com/collection/996823e0-8104-4490-b26a-f2f733f810fb?0) that have analysed the "Open Access citation advantage" have found that OA articles tend to receive more citations. Again, this is conceptially common sense. If more people can access and read your work, more people can cite your work.

But it isn't just citations which OA influences. There are a number of other ways in which OA helps to amplify the reach and re-use of your work.

For example, a [study in 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23687) found that the odds of an OA journal being referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher compared to paywalled journals. Therefore, it seems that OA has a significant "amplifier" effect for the diffusion of scientific research communicated via other such platforms.

A study by [Erin McKiernan and colleagues](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/McKiernan%20et%20al.%2C%202016.pdf) said it the best:

> Open access, open data, open source and other open scholarship practices are growing in popularity and necessity. However, widespread adoption of these practices has not yet been achieved. One reason is that researchers are uncertain about how sharing their work will affect their careers. We review literature demonstrating that open research is associated with increases in citations, media attention, potential collaborators, job opportunities and funding opportunities. These findings are evidence that open research practices bring significant benefits to researchers relative to more traditional closed practices.

### Are there any potential downsides to Open Access?

Almost non-one disagrees with OA, in principles. However, as with many things there is a divergence between the ideology behind, and the practices of, OA. 

As with each module, we do not want to pretend like openness is this magical cure to all the problems in academia. There are constant and vigorous debates about all aspects of it, and Open Access is no exception. It is our duty to be honest to you all, and communicate some of the potential barriers and limitations to OA here.

Nicely, some good work has been done on this already. In [2018, Gareth Johnson](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Johnson%2C%202018.pdf) looked at the barriers to OA in the UK:

> Notably, while participants represented an array of potential mechanistic, policy or legal blocks, it was the academic community’s knowledge of and attitudes towards OA that were shown to present the greatest obstacles. Despite the endeavours of OA practitioners who were devoted to advocacy, the majority of scholars’ understanding or embrace of openness within research dissemination practice was found to be ‘patchy’, ‘ill-informed’ or ‘confused’.

There is also the fact that often, publishing OA does cost money. We discuss this in detail a lot in SECTION XXXX, and a lot of free alternative routes. However, the reality is often that if you want to publish OA in a specific journal, there will be charges associated with that. Therefore, it is up to you and your authors to be aware of potential funding sources that might be available to you. As well as the options for parallel 'green OA' or self-archiving that the journals permit.
