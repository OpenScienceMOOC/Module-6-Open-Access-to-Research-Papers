## What is Open Access <a name="open_access"></a>

### I learned about it in Open Access, a history

As always, we like to start these modules off by giving a nice history lesson to help provide additional context to how we arrived at the present state.

So, the history of Open Access (OA) actually goes back a long time before OA was even really a thing. OA is based around ideals and principles around sharing, and these existed long before the term "Open Access" was coined. For example, computer scientists and software developers have been freely archiving and sharing their code since the 1970s. Physicists have been sharing their articles and data since the early 1990s on a platform called "arXiv" (prounced ar-chi-ve).

The term "Open Access" itself was first formulated in three public statements made in the 2000s, considered to be pivotal moments in the history of OA. These are the:

* [Budapest Open Access Initiative](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) in February 2002 

* [Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm) in June 2003 

* [Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration) in October 2003

These declarations solidified the idea that unrestricted access to scholarly research was generally a good thing.

Open Access in its present recognisable form was catalysed by the invention of this thing you might have heard of called "the internet". Not just for cat gifs and adverts, theoretically, the power of the internet enabled scientific research to be transferred or copied at low cost, instantaneously, and with a wide audience. Thus, there was a large scope for disrupting the print-based nature of the publishing industry. While there were clear costs associated with producing research articles, the cost of the online distribution of these was essentially minimal.

As such, the world of pre-OA exploded in the 1990s. The fact was that it was eminently feasible now to publish scholarly research and make it instantly accessible almost anywhere in the world for free to readers.
