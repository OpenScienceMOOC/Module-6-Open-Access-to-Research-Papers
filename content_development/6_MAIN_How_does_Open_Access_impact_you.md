## How does Open Access impact you <a name="impact"></a>

There is a direct link between Open Access and you through the additional research impact it generates. Conceptually, it is hopefully not difficult to see that if more people can access and use something, that makes it more impactful.

While there is a clear ethical and more case for OA, communicating the personal impact it can have on individuals helps to leverage intrinsic motivations for researchers. As in, there has to be something in it for them. Thankfully, there is a strong almost universal case for an impact advantage for researchers who choose to publish OA.

For example, a traditional measure of research impact is the number of citations and article receives. Most studies that have analysed the "Open Access citation advantage" have found that OA articles tend to receive more citations. Again, this is conceptially common sense. If more people can access and read your work, more people can cite your work.

But it isn't just citations which OA influences. There are a number of other ways in which OA helps to amplify the reach and re-use of your work.

For example, a [study in 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.23687) found that the odds of an OA journal being referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher compared to paywalled journals. Therefore, it seems that OA has a significant "amplifier" effect for the diffusion of scientific research communicated via other such platforms.
