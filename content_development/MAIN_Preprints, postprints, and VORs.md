## Preprints, postprints, and VORs <a name="preprints"></a>

Below from Wikipedia, needs editing:
The first free scientific online archive was arXiv.org, started in 1991, initially a preprint service for physicists, initiated by Paul Ginsparg. Self-archiving has become the norm in physics, with some sub-areas of physics, such as high-energy physics, having a 100% self-archiving rate. The prior existence of a "preprint culture" in high-energy physics is one major reason why arXiv has been successful. arXiv now includes papers from related disciplines including computer science, mathematics, nonlinear sciences, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics. However, computer scientists mostly self-archive on their own websites and have been doing so for even longer than physicists. arXiv now includes postprints as well as preprints. The two major physics publishers, American Physical Society and Institute of Physics Publishing, have reported that arXiv has had no effect on journal subscriptions in physics; even though the articles are freely available, usually before publication, physicists value their journals and continue to support them.

    Pre-print - a manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.

    Post-print - a manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed.

    Version of Record (VOR) - the final version of a manuscript, after peer review and processing by a publishers.

    Hybrid - a type of journal in which certain articles are made open access for typically a significantly higher price (relative to full OA journals), while others remain toll access.

    Accepted author manuscript - the version of a manuscript that has been accepted by a publisher for publication.

    Eprint - a digital version of a research document available online for a repository.
