## Background
The intention of this video is to explain to learners why they should be doing this module. What the advantage of learning this material is, in terms of how it will affect their daily research practices. For this, it has to be personal stories: How Open Science has impacted you, why it is important to you, and a real world experience of it. The importance here is to emphasise the principles behind openness, so why you choose to engage with open science.

This video will come in at the Introduction just before the learning outcomes, and really nail why people should be taking this module by prociding a real human component and narrative.

Now, importantly, I want this video to be completely distinct from something like a formal university lecture, where the learning is plain and uni-directional from teacher to learner. I want it to be personal, natural, and engaging - you are all members of the community, and I see this as more peer-to-peer. So less floating heads and instructional, and more casual. What I want produce ultimately is something inspirational that gets people to go 'OK, this sounds useful to me and I should take and complete this module'.
