# Repositories & Open Access #

## Relevance of repositories in facilitating Open Access ##

'Repositories' have been a feature of the open science landscape since the beginning of the wider Open Access movement. Repositories, sometimes also referred to generically as 'open archives' or 'open repositories', are digital services which enable scholarly content creators to digitally archive their content and make this content openly available over the web. As we shall see, such repositories are an important feature of the Open Access landscape by supporting Green Open Access -- as well as alternative approaches to communicating scholarly work -- because they make scholarly content (typically research papers, journal articles, etc.) freely and openly available on the Internet, thereby maximising their visibility, dissemination and potential impact or reuse. 

There are a number of different types (or flavour) of Open Access repository and, depending on your occupation, it is necessary to be aware of the different options available. Some of the most common include types of repository include:

* **Institutional repositories (IR):** These are repositories that have been established by an institution, typically a university or other higher education institution. Their purpose is to provide Green OA repository services for their local academic community. Such repositories are among the most common type and support universities in the Open Access dissemination of their institutional research output. Examples of IRs include [ZORA](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/), the University of Zurich's repository or [ScholarBank@NUS](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/), based at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

* **Subject- or disciplinary repositories:** These are repositories which coalesce around a specific discipline (instead of an institution) and which are typically maintained by a community of practice. In particular disciplines the use of such repositories can be highly favoured because they are of such scale within their subject area that they are the best way of communicating research. Examples of subject- or disciplinary repositories include the [arXiv EPrints Archive](https://arxiv.org/), a repository based on mathematical sciences such as physics, computer science, quantitative biology and mathematics. Or [Earth-Prints](https://www.earth-prints.org/), specicialising on open content from the fields of atmospheric, cryospheric, hydrospheric and solid earth science. 

* **Preprint repositories:** Preprint repositories are platforms for exposing and sharing academic papers (or other academic works) **prior to formal peer-review**. This enables the rapid sharing of research results thereby obviating any lenthy peer-review to publication timelines. Examples of preprint repositories include [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), focussing on the biological sciences, and [SportRχiv](http://sportrxiv.org/) specializing in preprints within the sport, exercise, performance, and health research areas. 

* **Mega-repositories:** These are large-scale repositories which have few discernible restrictions on the type of scholarly material deposited, its peer-review status, or its discipline. Such repositories tend to be generalist in their scope, allowing participation from a wide variety of academic users. A good example of a mega-repository would be [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

## What are the benefits of repositories? ##

### Socio-technical benefits of repositories ###

As instruments open science, the benefits of repositories are their ability to support the many objectives of Open Access.

* **Universal access:** Repositories can support Open Access by providing an open and free-at-the-point-of-use digital platform for researchers to upload, deposit and publish their work outside of the normal scholarly publications system. This openness enhances the public value of their research because all users, irrespective of their means, can access that research. In other words, an article published in a journal may only be available to a small number of subscribers if it sits behind a paywall, but the very same article is available to all when it is made available via a repository.  

* **Equity in Open Access publishing:** As we have noted in other areas of this module, researchers' ability to pursue Gold Open Access is severely restricted by their access to funding in order to pay the necessary article processing charges (APCs) levied by some publishers. This risks creating a 'digital divide' among scholars and disenfranchising many from participating in scholarly discourse. There are also concerns that Gold OA is unscalable and too costly as a means of providing universal OA. Open Access via repositories, or Green OA, therefore provides a free avenue to OA and one which helps to balance the costs of delivering it.     

### Technical benefits of repositories ###

* **Discovery:** One of the unique features of repositories is that they often support a wide variety of technical protocols that enable discovery tools, from generic academic search tools such as [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to more specialist tools such as [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) or [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/), [DS Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) or [Lens.org](https://www.lens.org/), to interoperate with repositories. This allows these discovery tools to learn about the research outputs contained in repositories in a way these systems prefer, but also enables these systems to direct their users to the research which repositories holds. Repositories are therefore very good tools for enhancing the discovery and dissemination of the research papers which have been deposited in the repository.

	The repository software, upon which the various flavours are based, are typically open source. As well as facilitating their development in line with Open Access objectives, their open nature has meant that they have been developed to interoperate with as many systems within the wider open scholarly communications infrastructure.
	
	Repository systems are also central to new in-browser Open Access tools such as Unpaywall, CORE Discovery and the Open Access Button, allowing users to discover openly available research papers whenever they encounter a paywall.

* **Digital preservation and persistence:** Repositories are generally managed by libraries or affiliated communities and have a commitment to ensuring long-term access to content deposited in the repository. This includes ensuring deposits are digitally preserved and maintained over time, thereby ensuring persistence in content access over time. This concept of persistence is highly important for ensuring the verifiability of the scholarly record as scholarly publications become entirely digital.

* **Persistent locations:** The aforementioned digital preservation actions that libraries, archives and repository managers are taken to ensure persistence in the digital files. But persistent, citable file locations are equally important. In other words, once a research paper is deposited in a repository its location should be static over time. It should be *persistent*. This once again ensures preservation of the scholarly record since the URLs used to cite research stored in a repository will never change - or if they do will always resolve to the correct location. Repositories use succinct URLs known as 'handles' to promote the concept of persistence. Some may also offer universally recognized persistent identifiers, such as digital objective identifiers (DOIs), emphasizing the importance of persistence in the publication of open research.      

* **New computational research techniques:** One of the many technical protocols repositories support is OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting). OAI-PMH and other related emerging protocols, enable services - known as harvesters or *aggregators* - to aggregate the contents of thousands of repositories within a single location. The aggregation of literally tens of millions of research papers raises the prospect of new, exciting computational research techniques. One such technique is text and data mining (TDM). TDM is the computational analysis of vast volumes of digital research content to identify patterns, trends or other useful information which cannot be identified by manual reading (normally owing to the prohibitive size of content, i.e. millions of research papers).

## Identifying a suitable repository to use ##

Depending on your job role, finding a suitable repository to use could be simple. For example, if you are working at an institution which supports an **institutional repository** then your decision should be simple: use the local repository. However, there may be instances where you do not have access to an institutional repository (e.g. freelance researcher, citizen scientist, etc.), or you would like to also reach a different audience. In this case you may prefer to use an alternative repository flavour, such as a subject-based repository.

When veering outside the institutional repository solutions available it can, at times, be difficult to identify suitable repository options. In these instances it is worth consulting the [Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR)](http://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/). OpenDOAR is a quality-assured global directory of Open Access repositories. It enables users to identify, browse and search for repositories. For example, while subject might be important, you may also be more interested on the range of features available from the repository, the types of materials that tend to be deposited there or perhaps location.

### Manuscript types: what, why & how? ###

The haphazard evolution of OA since the early 2000s - and the divergent conventions which have emerged during this time - is such that the terminology and jargon surrounding manuscript types can be confusing to newcomers. 

In general, there are 3 manuscript types to be aware of in Green OA. All of them are useful and fulfil an important purpose; however, as we shall see, some better satisfy aspects of funders' OA policies. The 3 manuscript types emerge at different points in the publication lifecycle - and a useful diagram from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.openaccess.cam.ac.uk/) (below) highlights the different types and at which point in the lifecycle they emerge.

![Open Access manuscript types - publication lifecycle](images/publicationprocessdiagram.jpg?raw=true)

* **Preprints (or 'submitted version')**: A preprint is a copy of a manuscript before it has been submitted to a journal or conference for peer-review, or review by a publisher. This type of manuscript is commonly deposited in order to facilitate the rapid publication of results or findings, or indeed to canvas feedback or review from similarly minded scholars. As noted previously, there are a growing number of preprint repositories based within a wide variety of disciplines. Citation of preprints in research papers has therefore become increasingly acceptable, providing the paper's 'preprint' status is noted. Indicating the nature of a preprint paper is necessary because such papers do not benefit from the usual academic peer-review methods, which are used to assess or maintain research quality standards and provide credibility to results or findings.

* **Post-prints (of 'accepted author manuscripts')**: A post-print or accepted author manuscript (AAM) is a copy of a manuscript after it has been through the peer-review process. It will have changes and improvements which were the direct result of the peer-review process, and it will be the version of the manuscript which has been accepted for publication by the journal editor, conference organizer, or similar. Post-prints do not typically include any publisher formatting or copy-editing although, depending on the journal or publisher, it may have some owing to drafting within template MS Word or LaTex files. 
In discussions surrounding Green OA it is generally acknowledged that the post-print (or AAM) is the *preferred* version of a manuscript to deposit in a repository because its content has been through peer-review and, as such, the intellectual content of the post-print will be identical to the 'version of record'.

* **Version of record (or 'final published version' or 'publisher's version')**: The version of record refers to the version of the manuscript which has been formatted, copy-edited and appears in print or online - normally via a journal or conference website.  

### SHERPA/RoMEO ###

Knowing which version(s) of the manuscript you are permitted to deposit in a repository is important. In an earlier section, [Preprints postprints and VORs](8_MAIN_Preprints_postprints_and_VORs.md), the [SHERPA/RoMEO](sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/) service was introduced briefly. SHERPA/RoMEO is a searchable database of the Green OA policies supported by specific publishers and journals. RoMEO can tell users which manuscript versions can be deposited in repositories and under what conditions.

It is important to remember that -- as an author who may have submitted a manuscript to a journal publisher or conference organizer -- it will normally be necessary to sign a [copyright transfer agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Copyright_transfer_agreement&oldid=916302646) (CTA) with the publisher. This transfer is necessary to enable publication and subsequent reproduction of your paper by that publisher. However, it is not uncommon for the CTA to also restrict what authors are permitted to do with their manuscripts. RoMEO therefore provides intelligence about exceptions to publisher CTAs, which manuscript versions can be deposited and any other relevant conditions.

The figure below (a screen snippet from RoMEO) sets out the typical intelligence that is provided by RoMEO. The [live page can be accessed on RoMEO](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/issn/1556-4673/) directly. A simple 'tick' and 'cross' approach highlights the basic rights available to the user/author. For example, in the example below for the [Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage](http://sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/issn/1556-4673/) we can note that the author can:

* Deposit ('archive') his/her pre-print in a repository.

* Deposit their accepted author manuscript ('post-print'), but;

* Cannot deposit the version of record.

Additionally, the entry for this journal in RoMEO stipulates some additional requirements. These are set out in the 'general conditions' section and include such things as, 'Must link to publisher version', and the inclusion of a 'set statement' on the repository or the manuscript itself.

RoMEO therefore provides a useful tool in quickly determining what publishers have to deposit their work in a repository.

As a general open science rule, retaining author rights is paramount. By retaining rights scholars can ensure optimum value is
