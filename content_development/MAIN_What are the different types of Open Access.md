## What are the different types of Open Access <a name="types"></a>

[NOTE this is just copied from Wikipedia atm so needs some editing]

Different open access types are currently commonly described using a colour system. The most commonly recognised names are "green", "gold", and "hybrid" open access; however a number of others terms are also used for additional models.

Gold OA
Full open access publishing is performed by gold OA publishers. The publisher makes all articles and related content available for free immediately on the journal's website. In such publications, articles are licensed for sharing and reuse via creative commons licenses or similar.

Green OA
Self-archiving by authors is permitted under green OA. After peer review by a journal, the author posts the same content the journal will be publishing to a website controlled by the author, the research institution that funded or hosted the work, or which has been set up as a central open access repository.

Hybrid OA
Hybrid open access journals, contain a mixture of open access articles and closed access articles. A publisher following this model is partially funded by subscriptions, and only provide open access for those individual articles for which the authors (or research sponsor) pay a publication fee.

Bronze OA
Delayed open-access journals publish articles initially as subscription-only, then release them as open access after an embargo period (varying from months to years). In this way subscribers get early access to content.

Diamond/platinum OA
The journals which publish open access without charging authors article processing charges are sometimes referred to as platinum or diamond OA. Since they do not charge either readers or authors, such publishers often require funding from external sources such as academic institutions, learned societies, philanthropists or government grants

About 10,000 journals without APC are listed in DOAJ and the Free Journal Network.

Black OA
The growth of digital piracy by large-scale copyright infringement has allowed enabled free access to paywalled literature In some ways this is a large-scale technical implementation of pre-existing practice, whereby those with access to paywalled literature would share copies with their contacts. However the increased ease and scale from 2010 onwards have changed how many people treat subscription publications.
