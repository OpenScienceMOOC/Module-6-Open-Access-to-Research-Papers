## Module 5: Initiate and plan

### Define the target groups
   
   - Virtually all researchers
   - Graduate and undergraduate students
   - Librarians, trainers, advocates

### Refine the learning objectives and outcomes
   
1. The researcher will become familiar with the history of scholarly publishing, and development of the present Open Access landscape.
1. The researcher will gain a multi-stakeholder insight into Open Access, and be able to convey a balanced overview of the perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with Open Access publishing.
1. The researcher will be able to describe some of the complexities of the current the Open Access landscape, including allowances for self-archiving and embargoes, copyright transfer, and publishing contracts.
1. Based on community-specific practices, the researcher will be able to use the different types of outlets (repositories) available for self-archiving, as well as the range of Open Access journal types available to them.
1. Each researcher will able to make all of their own research papers Open Access through a combination of journals and development of a personal self-archiving protocol.
1. Researchers will be able to describe the current ebb and flow in the debates around preprints, and be able to locate and use relevant disciplinary preprint platforms.
1. Researchers will be able to use services like ImpactStory to track the proportion of their research that is Open Access.
