## Why is Open Access important <a name="important"></a>

Imagine someone in your family falls ill with a particular disease. You want to learn more about it, so you can understand it more. So, you turn to the scientific record.


### What is the ethical basis for Open Access? <a name="ethics"></a>

One of the core arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through government grants. Therefore the public should have a fundamental right to access the results of what they have funded.

With OA, every single person in the world can read articles, providing they have an internet connection, and not just those whose library can afford to subscribe to journals. Faster and more widespread discoveries benefit everyone. High school and college students can gain the information literacy skills they need and are critical for the knowledge age. Patients clearly benefit when their doctor and other health care professionals have access to the latest research.

This is not just a problem in Europe and North America too. This is a global problem, and it particularly affects developing nations. If the costs are too high in the developed world, just imagine how it affects those in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Many countries and individuals simply can not afford to subscribe to access the scholarly literature. While the [HINARI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HINARI) program helps with access to some health research, such initiatives clearly acknowledge the unethical basis for the present system - knowledge discrimination based on financial privilege.
