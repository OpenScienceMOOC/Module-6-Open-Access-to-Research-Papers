## The cost and economics of Open Access <a name="economics"></a>

Open Access represents a whole different funding game for scholarly journals. While they were typically supported by subscriptions (and often submission fees), meaning only selected people had access, the advent of OA meant that this revenue stream was lost. This means new ones had to be found.

While the most commonly known method here is that of APCs, or "article-processing charges", there are a number of models that can be used to cover journal costs.

There are many publishers that started up as OA-only publishers (or "born OA" publishers), such as [PLOS](http://plos.org/), [Hindawi](http://hindawi.com/), [Frontiers](http://frontiersin.org/), [MDPI](http://mdpi.com/) and [BioMed Central](https://www.biomedcentral.com/). These big commercial publishers are almost exclusively funded through these APCs.

But what exactly is an APC? These are author-facing fees that are designed to cover the cost of publication, or processing, of an article. This can include both direct processing costs, as well as indirect costs, such as those of running a company. Often, these fees are not paid by the authors themselves, but come from grants or libraries if based at a research institute.

Even for learned society journals, [in 2007 a study](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/11-02-07.htm#list) showed that 83% of OA journals do not charge publication fees. As of June 2018, only 26% of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) required payment of APCs. Another [analysis by Heather Morrison](https://sustainingknowledgecommons.org/2018/02/06/doaj-apc-information-as-of-jan-31-2018/) found similar results:

> As of January 31, 2018, 71% of the 11,001 journals listed in DOAJ do not charge APCs. 28% do charge APCs, and the remainder have no information on APCs.

Therefore, **OPEN ACCESS IS NOT ALL ABOUT APCS**. Just to make that absolutely clear.

### Free is in freedom, not as in beer

Often, you will hear the rather tedious rhetoric that "Open Access costs money" or "someone has to pay". This is a usually a corporate tagline from a publisher who has had their business model completely threatened by the Web and wants to do everything they can to protect their revenue. We know it costs money. We know it is not free. 

However, this statement is a diversion. The true question, which is difficult to answer, is "How much should it cost?"

Another [recent study](https://peerj.com/preprints/27809/) showed that the actual costs associated with publishing can be as low as around a few dollars to a few hundred dollars at scale. The Journal of Open Source Software costs about [$2.71 per article](http://blog.joss.theoj.org/2019/06/cost-models-for-running-an-online-open-journal). Critical services like arXiv costed $925,000 to run in 2017, publishing [123,523 articles](https://arxiv.org/help/stats/2017_by_area/index) during that time - around $7.48 per article, without any peer-reviewing/editing/publishing work. By comparison, Springer Nature estimates that it costs between [€10-30,000 euros per article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00596-x) for publishing in one of their Nature-branded journals. 

Let that all sink in. Now, with Plan S, things are not getting better. Recenly, Germany [gave €26 million to Wiley](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/deal-reveals-what-scientists-germany-are-paying-open-access), for publishing 9.500 articles per year over 3 years; around €2,750 per article. Wiley has an [operating net profit margin of around 29.5%](https://twitter.com/rt_thibault/status/1033777449551638528?s=20), which means that of this contract, around €7.7 million goes straight into Wiley’s shareholder pockets. A similar deal between Wiley and Dutch universities seems to be costing more than [€4,000 per article](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/1098921776820744192) at the present. 

A [recent study](https://www.liberquarterly.eu/articles/10.18352/lq.10280/) has even shown that the current status of OA, and its increasing favour on commercially-driven companies with high APCs, is creating a second crisis due to hyperinflation and the lack of market control.

There currently is a growing debate regarding the linked ideology and ethics between OA and APCs. Often, these charges are being created and managed by commercial publishing conglomerates together with some national and international academic institutions and government bodies. What APCs do, sadly, is create another financial barrier to participate in the communication of knowledge. This discrimination is why many journals offer fee-waiver policies to authors with demonstrable need.

>  Some no-fee OA journals have direct or indirect subsidies from institutions like universities, laboratories, research centers, libraries, hospitals, museums, learned societies, foundations, or government agencies.  Some have revenue from a separate line of non-OA publications.  Some have revenue from advertising, auxiliary services, membership dues, endowments, reprints, or a print or premium edition.  Some rely, more than other journals, on volunteerism.  Some undoubtedly use a combination of these means.  But we don't know how many other sources of revenue might be missing from this short list.  We don't know how many no-fee journals use which method, and we don't know how the methods compare with one another for financial sustainability.

Other innovative ways of covering costs can be seen in [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) and the [Open Library of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org/). PeerJ operates under a membership model, with different tiers allowing for one ($399), two ($449), or five ($499) peer-reviewed publications per 12-month period. This represents a significant departure from the APC model. The Open Library of Humanities is funded by an [international library consortium model](https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/), which enables them to publish journals with no author-facing APCs.

Other low-cost platforms including [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/). This system enables anyone to set up their own journal, including all hosting and publishing workflow services including peer review management. It is Open Source, exclusively OA, non-profit, researcher-friendly, and a member of MIT'S [Knowledge Futures Group](https://mitpress.mit.edu/kfg).
