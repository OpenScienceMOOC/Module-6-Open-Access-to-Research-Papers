## What are the different types of Open Access <a name="types"></a>

Different 'types' of Open Access  are currently commonly described using a simple colour system. The most commonly recognised are "green" and "gold" OA, among a number of others terms that are also used for additional models, each with a specific [definition](http://www.righttoresearch.org/resources/OpenResearchGlossary/).

**Gold OA**
The publisher makes all articles and related content available for free immediately on the journal's website. In such publications, articles are licensed for sharing and reuse via Creative Commons licenses or equivalents.

**Green OA**
Also commonly called "self-archiving". After peer review through a traditional journal, the author posts the accepted manuscript to a website, such as an institutional or subject-based repository.

**Bronze OA**
Delayed OA journals publish articles initially as subscription-only, then release them as OA after an embargo period (varying from months to years). Bronze OA articles can also have unclear licensing agreements that hamper their re-use.

**Diamond/platinum OA**
Journals which publish OA without charging authors article processing charges (APCs) are known as platinum or diamond. Since they do not charge either readers or authors, such publishers often require funding from external sources such as academic institutions, learned societies, or government grants.

> Fun fact: 71% of the 11,001 journals listed in the Directory for Open Access Journals (DOAJ) do not charge APCs (via [Heather Morrison](https://sustainingknowledgecommons.org/2018/02/06/doaj-apc-information-as-of-jan-31-2018/)).

**Black OA**
The growth of what is sometimes referred to as "digital piracy" through large-scale copyright infringement has allowed enabled free access to paywalled literature at a massive scale.

**Hybrid OA**
Hybrid OA journals are those that contain a mixture of OA articles and subscription articles. The journal remains funded by subscriptions, with individual articles being made OA through a publication fee.

As well as the colours, there are also two other generic types of OA that are based on licensing and copyright terms:

* **Gratis OA** - The paper is available to read free-of-charge, though its reuse is still restricted, for example by 'All Rights Reserved' copyright.

* **Libre OA** - The paper is made available under an open licence, allowing it to be shared and reused, depending on which licence is used.

Or in other words, gratis refers to online access free of charge ("free as in beer"), and libre refers to online access free of charge plus some additional re-use rights ("free as in freedom"). This is similar to the distinction between [Free Software and Open Source](https://eliademy.com/catalog/oer/module-5-open-research-software-and-open-source.html).
