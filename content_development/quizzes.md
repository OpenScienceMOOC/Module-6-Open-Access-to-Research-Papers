## Questions

### 1. Open Science is primarily occupied with liberating the (Natural) Sciences (e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Biology, etc.), true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** No, Open Science tries to encompass all scientific activity. For a broader outline of what we at OpenScienceMOOC think Open Science should be, see our first Module on Open Principles.
In case you want to dig a bit deeper, we recommend a peek at the Foundations of Open Scholarship Strategy Development document, which is available e.g. on MetaArXiv ( https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/b4v8p ).

### 2. Open Access articles are not peer reviewed, true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** Yup, that's a common misconception. Open Access articles undergo the same rigorous peer review as articles published via the traditional subscription-based publishing model.

### 3. Unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction of Open Access articles licensed under CC-BY is permitted only when you:

- [ ] ... have asked the author(s)
- [X] ... have attributed the author(s)
- [ ] ... are also publishing Open Access
- [ ] ... you do not need to do anything

**Answer:** The "BY" in CC BY points to obligatory attribution when re-use is happening, so the author(s) should be properly attributed if you wish to use, distribute or reproduce their article. By the way, this is nothing out of the ordinary, but simply reflects the scholarly practice of citation within academia ;)

### 4. Open Access and open peer review are the same thing, true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** Open Access journals, just like non-OA journals, may use any of the different peer review models, including single-blind, double-blind, open or post-publication peer review. We will learn more about this in the module on Open Evaluation!

For more on the topic of peer review, see e.g.

Tennant et al. (2017) A multi-disciplinary perspective on emergent and future innovations in peer review; https://doi.org./10.12688/f1000research.12037.1

or

Ross-Hellauer and Görögh (2019) Guidelines for open peer review implementation. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-019-0063-9

### 5. You can download an Open Access article and make copies to distribute to your friends, true or false?

- [X] True
- [ ] False

**Answer:** Yes, that’s right! Open Access articles can be downloaded, printed and distributed to all your friends and colleagues, without any restrictions to access such as paywalls. Such practices are typically prohibited under subscription articles, and you can be legally challenged for doing such things under breach of copyright law.

### 6. Publishing in Open Access journals makes it easier to disseminate your research via social media, true or false?

- [X] True
- [ ] False

**Answer:** When you share Open Access articles on social media, everyone is able to see your work making your research more visible to your community. You can read more on the evidence for this here:

McKiernan et. al. (2016) Point of View: How open science helps researchers succeed. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16800.001

### 7. Journals can have both Open Access and subscription only content, true or false?

- [X] True
- [ ] False

**Answer:** True! Subscription journals which offer authors an Open Access option for their individual articles are known as ‘hybrid’ journals. Unfortunately, these journals are typically worse in many ways than their fully-OA cousins:

### 8. Funding organizations don’t approve of Open Access journals, true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** Wrong! Many funding organizations now mandate that the work they fund is published under the Open Access model so that the research is available to a wide audience and cover the costs of publishing in their grants. Hundreds of research funders, institutes, and other organisations now have policies and funds for OA: http://whyopenresearch.org/funding

More recently, Plan S has ignited a new international wave of funder-driven moves towards a system of OA: https://www.coalition-s.org/

### 9. You can find out about the open access policies of funders at which website?

- [ ] SHERPA/ROMEO
- [ ] SHERPA/FACT
- [X] SHERPA/JULIET

**Answer:** It's SHERPA/JULIET - funded by Jisc and RLUK, this database provides information on research funders’ open access policies. It is available to view at their website at https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/


### 10. Nobody reads Open Access articles!

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** In fact, a huge number of research has shown that there is a readership, sharing, and citation advantage if you publish your work Open Access! See here for a list of studies analysing this:
Tennant et al. (2016) The academic, economic and societal impacts of Open Access: an evidence-based review. https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.8460.3

### 11. I have to pay a lot of money to make my own work Open Access

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** While many journals do charge high prices to publish Open Access, they almost always allow some sort of free self-archiving of the accepted, peer reviewed manuscripts - often called "postprints". This is generally termed 'green Open Access', and varies depending on publisher or journal. According to the Directory of Open Access Journals - https://doaj.org/ - there is also a huge variety of journals that are Open Access and do not charge authors to publish: around 12,000 journals, or more than 70% of all OA journals listed there!
So, all in all, there is almost always a free or low cost option for authors that does not compromise your choice of venue to publish in. They key point is that there is not a single business model for Open Access.
You can investigate the self-archiving policies for more than 2,500 publishers here: http://sherpa.mimas.ac.uk/romeo/statistics.php
