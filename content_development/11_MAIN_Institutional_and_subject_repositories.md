# Repositories & Open Access #

## Relevance of repositories in facilitating Open Access ##

'Repositories' have been a feature of the open science landscape since the beginning of the wider Open Access movement. Repositories, sometimes also referred to generically as 'open archives' or 'open repositories', are digital services which enable scholarly content creators to digitally archive their content and make this content openly available over the web. As we shall see, such repositories are an important feature of the Open Access landscape by supporting Green Open Access -- as well as alternative approaches to communicating scholarly work -- because they make scholarly content (typically research papers, journal articles, etc.) freely and openly available on the Internet, thereby maximising their visibility, dissemination and potential impact or reuse. 

There are a number of different types of repository and, depending on your occupation, it is necessary to be aware of the different options available. Some of the most common include types of repository include:

* **Institutional repositories (IR):** These are repositories that have been established by an institution, typically a university or other higher education institution. Their purpose is to provide Green OA repository services for their local academic community. Such repositories are among the most common type and support universities in the Open Access dissemination of their institutional research output. Examples of IRs include [ZORA](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/), the University of Zurich's repository or [ScholarBank@NUS](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/), based at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
 
* **Subject- or disciplinary repositories:** These are repositories which coalesce around a specific discipline (instead of an institution) and which are typically maintained by a community of practice. In particular disciplines the use of such repositories can be highly favoured because they are of such scale within their subject area that they are the best way of communicating research. Examples of subject- or disciplinary repositories include the [arXiv EPrints Archive](https://arxiv.org/), a repository based on mathematical sciences such as physics, computer science, quantitative biology and mathematics. Or [Earth-Prints](https://www.earth-prints.org/), specicialising on open content from the fields of atmospheric, cryospheric, hydrospheric and solid earth science. 

* Preprint repositories: bioRxiv, etc  

* Mega-repositories: Zenodo, etc.

## What are the benefits of repositories? ##

List here of usual benefits

One of the unique features of repositories is that they support a wide variety of technical protocols that enable discovery tools, from generic academic search tools such as Google Scholar to more specialist tools such as Core or BASE , DS Dimensions or 1findr , to interoperate with repositories. This allows these discovery tools to learn about the research outputs contained in repositories in a way these systems prefer, but also enables these systems to direct their users to the research which repositories holds.

Repository systems are also central to new in-browser Open Access tools such as Unpaywall and the Open Access Button, allowing users to discover openly available research papers whenever they encounter a paywall.
