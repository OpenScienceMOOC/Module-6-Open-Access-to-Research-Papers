### Tasks:

* Get an overview of the relevant journals and publishing outlets in your research discipline.

    * Which ones have Open Access options.

    * How much do they each charge for Open Access.

    * What funds are available to you to cover these (where relevant).

* Preferably, find out which diamond/platinum OA journals (i.e., those which do not charge APCs) with high-quality editorial policies exist in your field.

    * Check the description of the peer review process.

    * Check which other additional services are offered by the journal (e.g., XML conversion, publication of updated versions, text and data mining allowances).

    * Check journal whitelists (e.g., [The Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals, Series and Publishers](https://dbh.nsd.uib.no/publiseringskanaler/Forside.action?request_locale=en)).

* Draft a summary statement/report outlining the pros and cons of these outlets (e.g., editorial quality, OA policies).

    * What do your colleagues think about the credibility, advantages, and disadvantages of these outlets?

    * How does this compare to your views?

* Simple exercises on average "cost of a paper"; for example the average institute budget/publication output, or your last research grant/papers out compared to the average gold Open Access cost in that discipline.

* Find out if you are eligible for funds to pay for article-processing charges APCs.

    * Is the policy from your funder or institute?

    * What are the conditions?

* Find a way to make all of your research papers legally freely available.

    * Use SHERPA/RoMEO to detangle the legalese in publishing contracts.

    * Check with [Dissem.in](https://dissem.in/) which of your papers can be made Open Access via self-archiving.

    * Self-archive one paper (can be previously published) or share a pre-print to an archive.

    * Make sure to identify and include all relevant metadata (e.g. publisher requires citation with a URL to the final published version).

* Check ImpactStory to see the impact of your research outputs.

    * What can be improved?

    * What happens to your Open Access score when you self-archive your papers?

* Request an article using the OA Button.

    * Perhaps consider a Green OA advocacy volunteer effort for your discipline or a favorite journal in the spirit of the [Library Pipeline Green OA Working Group](https://www.librarypipeline.org/lis-publications/green-open-access/ ).

* Look for a local OA journal at your university or in your region.

    * Is there a preprint server for your research discipline?
