## The cost and economics of Open Access <a name="economics"></a>

Open Access represents a whole different funding game for scholarly journals. While they were typically supported by subscriptions (and often submission fees), meaning only selected people had access, the advent of OA meant that this revenue stream was lost. This means new ones had to be found.

While the most commonly known method here is that of APCs, or "article-processing charges", there are a number of models that can be used to cover journal costs.

There are many publishers that started up as OA-only publishers (or "born OA" publishers), such as [PLOS](http://plos.org/), [Hindawi](http://hindawi.com/), [Frontiers](http://frontiersin.org/), [MDPI](http://mdpi.com/) and [BioMed Central](https://www.biomedcentral.com/). These big commercial publishers are almost exclusively funded through these APCs.

But what exactly is an APC? These are author-facing fees that are designed to cover the cost of publication, or processing, of an article. This can include both direct processing costs, as well as indirect costs, such as those of running a company. Often, these fees are not paid by the authors themselves, but come from grants or libraries if based at a research institute.

For example, as of June 2018, only 26% of journals in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) required payment of APCs. Therefore, **OPEN ACCESS IS NOT ALL ABOUT APCS**. Just to make that absolutely clear.

Even for learned society journals, [in 2007 a study](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/11-02-07.htm#list) showed that 83% of OA journals do not charge publication fees.

There currently is a growing debate regarding the linked ideology and ethics between OA and APCs. Often, these charges are being created and managed by commercial publishing conglomerates together with some national and international academic institutions and government bodies. What APCs do, sadly, is create another financial barrier to participate in the communication of knowledge. This discrimination is why many journals offer fee-waiver policies to authors with demonstrable need.

>  Some no-fee OA journals have direct or indirect subsidies from institutions like universities, laboratories, research centers, libraries, hospitals, museums, learned societies, foundations, or government agencies.  Some have revenue from a separate line of non-OA publications.  Some have revenue from advertising, auxiliary services, membership dues, endowments, reprints, or a print or premium edition.  Some rely, more than other journals, on volunteerism.  Some undoubtedly use a combination of these means.  But we don't know how many other sources of revenue might be missing from this short list.  We don't know how many no-fee journals use which method, and we don't know how the methods compare with one another for financial sustainability.

Other innovative ways of covering costs can be seen in [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) and the [Open Library of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org/). PeerJ operates under a membership model, with different tiers allowing for one ($399), two ($449), or five ($499) peer-reviewed publications per 12-month period. This represents a significant departure from the APC model. The Open Library of Humanities is funded by an [international library consortium model](https://www.openlibhums.org/site/about/), which enables them to publish journals with no author-facing APCs.
