## Painting a global picture of Open Access <a name="global"></a>

While the overall state of the scholarly publishing industry is dominated by major western publishing houses, there are a number of high-level international collaborations that challenge this oligopolistic landscape.

For example:

* **SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online)**: A comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of Latin American countries.

* **Bioline International**: A non-profit organization dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil.

* **RePEC (Research Papers in Economics)**: A collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries.

* **Public Knowledge Project**: Developed the open-source publishing software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which is now in use around the world

* **African Journals Online (AJOL)**:

* [**REDALYC**](http://www.redalyc.org/home.oa): A bibliographic database and a digital library of OA journals, supported by the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México with the help of numerous other higher education institutions and information systems.

* [**LA Referencia**](http://www.lareferencia.info/en/): A platform that gives visibility to the scientific production of higher education and research institutions in Latin America, promotes open and free access to the full text, with special emphasis on publicly financed results.
