## Open Access and discoverability <a name="discoverability"></a>

Google Scholar is probably pretty much every researcher's go to choice for academic search engine. And while it does a pretty good job of letting you know if you have access to a PDF or not, what it often does not tell you is whether these articles are in violation of copyright or not.

Open Access, true OA, articles do not violate copyright. And they can be more easily discovered and re-used as part of this.

There are now a cool array of what we might call 'open discovery engines' that help you to discover OA content amidst the millions of articles out there.

For example, [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/) provides a visual network-like interface integrated with [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/) (all disciplines) and [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) (life sciences).

Other alternative discovery platforms include [ScienceOpen](https://www.scienceopen.com/), which we further discuss in the section on scholarly collaboration platforms.

There are a couple of steps that you as an individual can take to ensure that your own OA publications are discoverable by the variety of existing search engines out there.

In brief, these comprise the generation of standardized metadata that describe your work in a machine-readable way. Many of the existing repositories including [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), and the Open Science Framework [osf.io](https://osf.io/) automatically do this for you, so we think it advisable to use these or other repositories (including those offered by your home institution) to make your work available online (see also Green OA).

Now, while metadata help make your work discoverable, they also have the additional benefit of increasing the **accessibility of your publication**, because support tools such as screen readers make extensive use of available metadata. Further to that, **reproducibility** of your work is improved through metadata. (see e.g. Kemp et al. 2018)

For more details on these, see e.g. the [JISC guidelines](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/open-access-discovery-usage-and-impact).
