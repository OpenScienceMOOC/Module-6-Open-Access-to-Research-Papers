## What is Open Access <a name="open_access"></a>

**Open Access**: Making peer reviewed scholarly manuscripts freely available via the Internet, permitting any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any lawful purpose, without financial, legal or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. May also refer to theses, books, book chapters, monographs and other content. (BOAI, [source](http://www.righttoresearch.org/resources/OpenResearchGlossary/#core))

### I learned about it in Open Access, a history

As always, we like to start these modules off by giving a nice history lesson to help provide additional context to how we arrived at the present state.

So, the history of Open Access (OA) actually goes back a long time before OA was even really a thing. OA is based around ideals and principles around sharing, and these existed long before the term "Open Access" was coined. For example, computer scientists and software developers have been freely archiving and sharing their code since the 1970s. Physicists have been sharing their articles and data since the early 1990s on a platform called "arXiv" (prounced ar-chi-ve). These ideas are rooted in that of the "[Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons)" - that all resources be made accessible to all members of society.

The OA movement was/is primarily motivated by the social inequalities created by restricting access to scholarly research. This model tends to favor large and wealthy institutions with the financial means to purchase access to many journals. However, it was also catalysed by the economic challenges and perceived unsustainability of the wider academic publishing industry.

The term "Open Access" itself was first formulated in three public statements made in the 2000s, considered to be pivotal moments in the history of OA. These are the:

* [Budapest Open Access Initiative](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) in February 2002, launched by the Open Society Institute. 

* [Bethesda Statement on Open Access Publishing](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm) in June 2003 

* [Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities](https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration) in October 2003

These declarations solidified the idea that unrestricted access to scholarly research was generally a good thing. And this is what OA is: **The free and unrestricted access to scholarly research**.

Open Access in its present recognisable form was catalysed by the invention of this thing you might have heard of called "the internet". Not just for cat gifs and adverts, theoretically, the power of the internet enabled scientific research to be transferred or copied at low cost, instantaneously, and with a wide audience. Thus, there was a large scope for disrupting the print-based nature of the publishing industry. While there were clear costs associated with producing research articles, the cost of the online distribution of these was essentially minimal.

As such, the world of pre-OA exploded in the 1990s. The fact was that it was eminently feasible now to publish scholarly research and make it instantly accessible almost anywhere in the world for free to readers. The first "free access" or "open access" journals began to emerge in the 1980s-90s, followed shortly after with the first OA books. In the first decade of the 2000s, it is estmiated that the number of OA journals exploded again by around a 500% increase, with a 900% in increase in the number of OA articles.

[INSERT XKCD INFOGRAPHIC TIMELINE]

In 2000, [BioMed Central](https://www.biomedcentral.com/), a for-profit OA publisher with now dozens of open access journals, was launched. One year later, 34,000 researchers signed an [Open Letter to Scientific Publishers](https://www.webcitation.org/6AhOrks2R?url=http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Signers-List-111610.pdf) calling for widespread OA to become the norm. This ultimately led to the founding of [PLOS](https://www.plos.org/) - the Public Library Of Science as an advocacy organisation, which later became a fully OA publisher in 2003.

Outside of Europe and North America, [SciELO](https://scielo.org/en/) (Scientific Electronic Library Online) was launched in 1997. SciELO is a bibliographic database, digital library, and cooperative electronic publishing model of OA journals. SciELO was created to meet the scientific communication needs of developing countries and provides an efficient way to increase visibility and access to scientific literature, particularly in Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula, and South Africa. It was originally established in Brazil, and now today there are 16 countries in the SciELO network and its journal collections: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Shortly after this new wave of OA, the non-OA publishers began to get worried, seeing it as a legitimate threat to their subscription-based business models. Publishers such as Wiley, Elsevier, and the American Chemical Society began an [aggressive lobbying and marketing campaign](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1790741/), led by a man known as the "pit bull of PR". This campaign included deliberately misleading statements to stifle the growth of OA, such as "public access equals government censorship". Therefore, it became clear in the mid-2000s that publishers and learned societies clearly did not have public access to knowledge in their best interests, as they saw it as a threat to their finances.

Following these developments, OA started to become more and more popular, and eventually starting hitting public policy at a global level. The latest big development here is that of "[Plan S](https://www.scienceeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Plan_S.pdf)", announced in September 2018. Here, 11 European research funders, organised under cOAlition S, announced the plan, which requires all research outputs based on funding from these organisations to be published in full OA journals.

### Licensing

As we also learn about in the [Open Source and Open Research Software module](), licensing here is fundamental to Open Access. Licensing provides a legal framework that grants certain rights to creators and users. Critical to OA is the ideal of unrestricted re-use, meaning remixing, sharing, and well, anything really. Research clearly works better when people are free to do with it whatever they want.
