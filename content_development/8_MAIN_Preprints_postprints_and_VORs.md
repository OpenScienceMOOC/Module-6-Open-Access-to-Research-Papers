## Preprints, postprints, and VORs <a name="preprints"></a>

Some useful definitions to start things off here include:

* **Preprint** - A manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.

* **Postprint** - A manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed.

* **Version of Record (VOR)** - The final version of a manuscript, after peer review and processing by a publishers.

* **Hybrid** - A type of journal in which certain articles are made open access for typically a significantly higher price (relative to full OA journals), while others remain toll access.

* **Accepted author manuscript** - The version of a manuscript that has been accepted by a publisher for publication.

* **Eprint** - A digital version of a research document available online for a repository.

### The case for preprints

The first experiments with preprints go all the way back to the 1960s ([Till, 2001](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102004)). Starting with the biomedical sciences, ths was before the internet so part of a paper-based preprint culture. The first free scientific online archive was [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), started in 1991, initially a preprint service for physicists, initiated by Paul Ginsparg. Since its origins, self-archiving has now become the norm in many sub-fields of physics, especially high-energy physics. Now, arXiv now includes papers from related disciplines including computer science, mathematics, nonlinear sciences, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics. arXiv now also includes postprints as well as preprints.

The main power of preprints is that they enable aaurthors to make their manuscripts freely and publicly available in parallel to, or before, submitting them to journals for formal peer review. As such, they help to communicate research results much faster than traditional methods ([Desjardins-Proulx et al., 2013](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Desjardins-Proulx%20et%20al.%2C%202013.PDF)). Other advantages include:

* Rapid dissemination to a wider audience

* Immediate visibility of research

* Demonstration of research progress, particularly for early-career researchers

* Availability for wider feedback from the research community

* Establishment of precedence or intellectual priority for research discoveries

* Potential citation advantage due to earlier and wider availability of research

Virtually all major publishers, including Elsevier, PLOS, Springer Nature, PNAS, and Wiley are friendly towards preprints. They allow them to be posted without compromising the publishability of authors' work in their journals. Therefore preprints are an excellent way to give researchers an advantage by increasing their publication record and citations.

Many publishers also allow preprints to be updated with the peer review or accepted manuscripts too, often even at the time of acceptance. Check journal policies either on their websites or SHERPA/RoMEO to see what you are permitted to share. A 2013 study by [Björk et al](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Bjork%20et%20al.%2C%202013.pdf) found that the 'green OA' coverage based on the sharing of these accepted manuscripts (postprints) was only around 12%, although with a lot of disciplinary variation. These were often shared in institutional repositories, but also on personal webpages of authors.

A recent analysis of preprints from biorXiv by [Abdill and Blekhman](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Abdill%20and%20Blekhman%2C%202019.pdf) demonstrated that, as of 2017, around two-thirds of preprints shared there ultimately end up in peer reviewed jorunals. Furthermore, articles shared as preprints tended to end up in 'higher impact' journals and receive more downloads.

### Examples of preprint servers/platforms

Here, platforms that end with "rXiv" of some sort are pronounced "archive" - the X is actually the Greek letter chi in these cases.

* [**Cogprints**](http://www.cogprints.org/) -  An electronic archive for self-archive papers in any area of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics, and many areas of Computer Science, Philosophy, and Biology.

* [**ESSOAr**](https://www.essoar.org/) - An Earth and Species Science open archive.

* [**ChemRxiv**](https://chemrxiv.org/) - A preprint server for Chemistry.

* [**SSRN**](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/) - The Social Sciences Research Network. Note that SSRN is now owned by Elsevier.

* [**Open Science Framework Preprints**](https://osf.io/preprints/) - A collection of preprint service providers that use the OSF open source infrastructure to support their communities.

* [**PrePubMed**](http://www.prepubmed.org/) - A platform that indexes preprints from arXiv q-bio, PeerJ Preprints, bioRxiv, F1000Research, preprints.org, The Winnower, Nature Precedings, and Wellcome Open Research.

* [**preLights**](https://prelights.biologists.com/) - A service from the biological community that highlights specific prepritns.

A really useful initiative in this space too is [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/). This is a researcher-driven non-profit promoting transparency and innovation in life science communication.

Several language-specific preprint servers have also recently emerged. These include [Arabixiv](https://arabixiv.org/) (Arabic), [Frenxiv](https://frenxiv.org/) (French), and [INA-Rxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/) (Indonesian), all hosted by the Open Science Framework.

Furthermore, a number of 'overlay' services now exist on top of preprints, including journals and other commenting/discussion platforms. Similar to the popular StackOverflow, services such as [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/) and [PhysicsOverflow](https://physicsoverflow.org/) provide discussion spaces where people can ask questions about preprints shared originally on the arXiv. Both include a community peer review system and postgraduate-level discussion forum. In the natural sciences, there is [biOverlay](https://www.bioverlay.org/post/welcome/). And in mathematics, [Discrete Analysis](https://discreteanalysisjournal.com/).

An exciting recent initiative in this space is [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org/). The “Peer Community in” (PCI) is a non-profit scientific organisation that aims to create specific communities of researchers reviewing and recommending, for free, unpublished preprints in their field (i.e. unpublished articles deposited on open online archives like arXiv.org and bioRxiv.org). So far, there are five specific communities that operate here: 

* [Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology](https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Paleontology](https://paleo.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Animal Science](https://animsci.peercommunityin.org/) 

* [Peer Community in Entomology](https://entomol.peercommunityin.org/)

## But how do I know which copy I can self-archive?

Thankfully, there is a service out there to make your life a little easier, called SHERPA/RoMEO. This is a database of journal self-archiving policies, and is based on a colour code:

* Green: Journals allow authors to share pre- and postprints
* Blue: Journals allow authors to share postprints
* Yellow: Journals allow authors to share preprints
* White: Journals to not formally allow authors to share their work

[ASAPbio also has a handy little educational resource](https://asapbio.org/new-licensing-resources) for open licensing for preprints.
