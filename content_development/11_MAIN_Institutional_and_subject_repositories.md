# Repositories & Open Access #

## Relevance of repositories in facilitating Open Access ##

'Repositories' have been a feature of the open science landscape since the beginning of the wider Open Access movement. Repositories, sometimes also referred to generically as 'open archives' or 'open repositories', are digital services which enable scholarly content creators to digitally archive their content and make this content openly available over the web. As we shall see, such repositories are an important feature of the Open Access landscape by supporting Green Open Access -- as well as alternative approaches to communicating scholarly work -- because they make scholarly content (typically research papers, journal articles, etc.) freely and openly available on the Internet, thereby maximising their visibility, dissemination and potential impact or reuse. 

There are a number of different types (or flavour) of Open Access repository and, depending on your occupation, it is necessary to be aware of the different options available. Some of the most common include types of repository include:

* **Institutional repositories (IR):** These are repositories that have been established by an institution, typically a university or other higher education institution. Their purpose is to provide Green OA repository services for their local academic community. Such repositories are among the most common type and support universities in the Open Access dissemination of their institutional research output. Examples of IRs include [ZORA](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/), the University of Zurich's repository or [ScholarBank@NUS](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/), based at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
 
* **Subject- or disciplinary repositories:** These are repositories which coalesce around a specific discipline (instead of an institution) and which are typically maintained by a community of practice. In particular disciplines the use of such repositories can be highly favoured because they are of such scale within their subject area that they are the best way of communicating research. Examples of subject- or disciplinary repositories include the [arXiv EPrints Archive](https://arxiv.org/), a repository based on mathematical sciences such as physics, computer science, quantitative biology and mathematics. Or [Earth-Prints](https://www.earth-prints.org/), specicialising on open content from the fields of atmospheric, cryospheric, hydrospheric and solid earth science. 

* **Preprint repositories:** Preprint repositories are platforms for exposing and sharing academic papers (or other academic works) **prior to formal peer-review**. This enables the rapid sharing of research results thereby obviating any lenthy peer-review to publication timelines. Examples of preprint repositories include [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), focussing on the biological sciences, and [SportRÏ‡iv](http://sportrxiv.org/) specializing in preprints within the sport, exercise, performance, and health research areas. 

* **Mega-repositories:** These are large-scale repositories which have few discernible restrictions on the type of scholarly material deposited, its peer-review status, or its discipline. Such repositories tend to be generalist in their scope, allowing participation from a wide variety of academic users. A good example of a mega-repository would be [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

## What are the benefits of repositories? ##

### Socio-technical benefits of repositories ###

As instruments open science, the benefits of repositories are their ability to support the many objectives of Open Access.

* **Universal access:** Repositories can support Open Access by providing an open and free-at-the-point-of-use digital platform for researchers to upload, deposit and publish their work outside of the normal scholarly publications system. This openness enhances the public value of their research because all users, irrespective of their means, can access that research. In other words, an article published in a journal may only be available to a small number of subscribers, but the very same article is available to all when it is made available via a repository.  

* **Equity in Open Access publishing:** As we have noted in other areas of this module, researchers' ability to pursue Gold Open Access is severely restricted by their access to funding in order to pay the necessary article processing charges (APCs) levied by some publishers. This risks creating a 'digital divide' among scholars and disenfranchising many from participating in scholarly discourse. There are also concerns that Gold OA is unscalable and too costly as a means of providing universal OA. Open Access via repositories, or Green OA, therefore provides a free avenue to OA and one which helps to balance the costs of delivering it.     

### Technical benefits of repositories ###

One of the unique features of repositories is that they often support a wide variety of technical protocols that enable discovery tools, from generic academic search tools such as [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to more specialist tools such as [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/) or [BASE](https://www.base-search.net/), [DS Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) or [Lens.org](https://www.lens.org/), to interoperate with repositories. This allows these discovery tools to learn about the research outputs contained in repositories in a way these systems prefer, but also enables these systems to direct their users to the research which repositories holds. Repositories are therefore very good tools for enhancing the discovery and dissemination of the research papers which have been deposited in the repository.

The repository software, upon which the various flavours are based, are typically open source. As well as enabling facilitating their development in line with Open Access objectives, their open nature has meant that they have been  and has been developed to interoperate with as many systems as possible.

Repository systems are also central to new in-browser Open Access tools such as Unpaywall and the Open Access Button, allowing users to discover openly available research papers whenever they encounter a paywall.
