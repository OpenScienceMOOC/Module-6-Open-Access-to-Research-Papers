## Preprints, postprints, and VORs <a name="preprints"></a>

Below from Wikipedia, needs editing:
The first free scientific online archive was arXiv.org, started in 1991, initially a preprint service for physicists, initiated by Paul Ginsparg. Self-archiving has become the norm in physics, with some sub-areas of physics, such as high-energy physics, having a 100% self-archiving rate. The prior existence of a "preprint culture" in high-energy physics is one major reason why arXiv has been successful. arXiv now includes papers from related disciplines including computer science, mathematics, nonlinear sciences, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics. However, computer scientists mostly self-archive on their own websites and have been doing so for even longer than physicists. arXiv now includes postprints as well as preprints. The two major physics publishers, American Physical Society and Institute of Physics Publishing, have reported that arXiv has had no effect on journal subscriptions in physics; even though the articles are freely available, usually before publication, physicists value their journals and continue to support them.

Some useful definitions here include:

* **Preprint** - A manuscript draft that has not yet been subject to formal peer review, distributed to receive early feedback on research from peers.

* **Postprint** - A manuscript draft after it has been peer reviewed.

* **Version of Record (VOR)** - The final version of a manuscript, after peer review and processing by a publishers.

* **Hybrid** - A type of journal in which certain articles are made open access for typically a significantly higher price (relative to full OA journals), while others remain toll access.

* **Accepted author manuscript** - The version of a manuscript that has been accepted by a publisher for publication.

* **Eprint** - A digital version of a research document available online for a repository.


### Examples of preprint servers/platforms

Here, platforms that end with "rXiv" of some sort are pronounced "archive" - the X is actually the Greek letter chi in these cases.

* [**Cogprints**](http://www.cogprints.org/) -  An electronic archive for self-archive papers in any area of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics, and many areas of Computer Science, Philosophy, and Biology.

* [**ESSOAr**](https://www.essoar.org/) - An Earth and Species Science open archive.

* [**ChemRxiv**](https://chemrxiv.org/) - A preprint server for Chemistry.

* [**SSRN**](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/) - The Social Sciences Research Network. Note that SSRN is now owned by Elsevier.

* [**Open Science Framework Preprints**](https://osf.io/preprints/) - A collection of preprint service providers that use the OSF open source infrastructure to support their communities.

* [**PrePubMed**](http://www.prepubmed.org/) - A platform that indexes preprints from arXiv q-bio, PeerJ Preprints, bioRxiv, F1000Research, preprints.org, The Winnower, Nature Precedings, and Wellcome Open Research.

* [**preLights**](https://prelights.biologists.com/) - A service from the biological community that highlights specific prepritns.

A really useful initiative in this space too is [ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/). This is a researcher-driven non-profit promoting transparency and innovation in life science communication.

Several language-specific preprint servers have also recently emerged. These include [Arabixiv](https://arabixiv.org/) (Arabic), [Frenxiv](https://frenxiv.org/) (French), and [INA-Rxiv](https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/) (Indonesian), all hosted by the Open Science Framework.

Furthermore, a number of 'overlay' services now exist on top of preprints, including journals and other commenting/discussion platforms. Similar to the popular StackOverflow, services such as [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/) and [PhysicsOverflow](https://physicsoverflow.org/) provide discussion spaces where people can ask questions about preprints shared originally on the arXiv. Both include a community peer review system and postgraduate-level discussion forum. In the natural sciences, there is [biOverlay](https://www.bioverlay.org/post/welcome/). And in mathematics, [Discrete Analysis](https://discreteanalysisjournal.com/).

An exciting recent initiative in this space is [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org/). The “Peer Community in” (PCI) is a non-profit scientific organisation that aims to create specific communities of researchers reviewing and recommending, for free, unpublished preprints in their field (i.e. unpublished articles deposited on open online archives like arXiv.org and bioRxiv.org). So far, there are five specific communities that operate here: 

* [Peer Community in Evolutionary Biology](https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Ecology](https://ecology.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Paleontology](https://paleo.peercommunityin.org/)

* [Peer Community in Animal Science](https://animsci.peercommunityin.org/) 

* [Peer Community in Entomology](https://entomol.peercommunityin.org/)

## But how do I know which copy I can self-archive?

Thankfully, there is a service out there to make your life a little easier, called SHERPA/RoMEO. This is a database of journal self-archiving policies, and is based on a colour code:

* Green: Journals allow authors to share pre- and postprints
* Blue: Journals allow authors to share postprints
* Yellow: Journals allow authors to share preprints
' White: Journals to not formally allow authors to share their work
