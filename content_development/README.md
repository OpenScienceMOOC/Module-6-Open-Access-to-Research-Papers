# Module 6 content development

These are the main content development files for this MOOC module.

Please refer to the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making changes here.

Anyone can join our [open Slack channel](https://osmooc.herokuapp.com/) and [team on GitHub](https://open-science-mooc-invite.herokuapp.com/) for the whole MOOC project.

## Core content

These are the draft content files. The content is fully accessible, and can be used for learning purposes, either individually or as a group, and can be shared and re-used as you wish. However, they have not been integrated into a formal MOOC platform yet. At the moment, they are being written in markdown format, and then using the [notedown](https://github.com/aaren/notedown) tool to convert into iPython notebook format. PDF and HTML versions are created using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/demos.html) and the [markdown to PDF](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-pdf) package for [Atom](https://atom.io/).

For notedown:
1. Make sure you're working in Linux or Debian
2. Change working directory: eg `cd /mnt/c/users/pc/desktop/`
3. Install notedown: `pip install notedown`
4. Convert files: `notedown input.md > output.ipynb`

**IMPORTANT** Please edit the **markdown** files, not the iPython/HTML files. These will be periodically converted and synchronised as needed.
