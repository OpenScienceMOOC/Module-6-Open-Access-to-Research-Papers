## Why is Open Access important <a name="important"></a>

Imagine someone in your family falls ill with a particular disease. You want to learn more about it, so you can understand it more. So, you turn to the scientific record. However, every research article which you want to read, which might offer you some comfort or understanding, is inaccessible. Time and time again, you encounter the paywall. Before even getting to look inside the article to see if it is useful, you are faced with a $35-40 price tag. This is how the present scholarly publishing system works. Great for those who can afford it, terrible for those who cannot. Most people on this planet cannot afford it.

### What is the ethical basis for Open Access? <a name="ethics"></a>

One of the core arguments for public access to the scholarly literature is that most of the research is paid for by taxpayers through government grants. Therefore the public should have a fundamental right to access the results of what they have funded.

With OA, every single person in the world can read articles, providing they have an internet connection, and not just those whose library can afford to subscribe to journals. Faster and more widespread discoveries benefit everyone. High school and college students can gain the information literacy skills they need and are critical for the knowledge age. Patients clearly benefit when their doctor and other health care professionals have access to the latest research.

This is not just a problem in Europe and North America too. This is a global problem, and it particularly affects developing nations. If the costs are too high in the developed world, just imagine how it affects those in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. Many countries and individuals simply can not afford to subscribe to access the scholarly literature. While the [HINARI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HINARI) program helps with access to some health research, such initiatives clearly acknowledge the unethical basis for the present system - knowledge discrimination based on financial privilege.

### The societal, economic, and academic impacts of OA

Many years ago (2016), in the pre-MOOC era, several of the now Steering Committee members wrote long, long, [research paper about the positive impacts of OA](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-632/v3). We found the case to be quite overwhelming, in particular the social case for OA is strong for advancing citizen engagement, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries.

Recently, [Fell, 2019](https://github.com/OpenScienceMOOC/Module-6-Open-Access-to-Research-Papers/blob/master/Reading%20Material_Open%20Access%20to%20Research%20Papers/Fell%2C%202019.pdf) looked at the economic impacts of open science, finding:

> There is indicative evidence that OA to findings/data can lead to savings in access costs, labour costs and transaction 15 costs. There are examples of open science enabling new products, services, companies, research and collaborations. Modelling studies suggest higher returns to Research and Devlopment if OA permits greater accessibility and efficiency of use of findings.

In 2017, the World Bank released a [blog post](http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/open-order-end-extreme-poverty-0) about the importance of OA for development. This post actually provides a really cool overview of some of the critical evidence supporting the importance of OA:

* Because OA articles are more visible, they receive anywhere from 25%-250% more citations for OA than Non-OA (NOA) articles in the same journal and year ([Houghton and Sheehan, 2009](http://vuir.vu.edu.au/15221/1/v39_i1_10_-houghton.pdf)).

* Open Access enhances and accelerates the research cycle - where work is published, read, cited and then built upon by other researchers ([Kuri, 2014](http://www.ajms.co.in/sites/ajms2015/index.php/ajms/article/view/329).  

* By facilitating additional use, OA leads to substantial measurable positive returns on investment returns, in one instance about £58 million to £230 million over 30 years (net present value) ([Beagrie & Houghton, 2014](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/5568/1/iDF308_-_Digital_Infrastructure_Directions_Report,_Jan14_v1-04.pdf)).

* OA enables entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) accelerate commercialization, innovation and discovery, also helping to overcome their limitations in paying for journal subscriptions and licensing restrictions which usually restrict re-use ([Mazzucato, 2011](http://oro.open.ac.uk/30159/1/Entrepreneurial_State_-_web.pdf)).
    
* OA maximizes prosperity effects. 60% reduction in the price of public sector spatial data in the Netherlands has been estimated to lead to a 40% annual turnover growth and employment growth of approximately 800 jobs ([Pluijmers, 2002](https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig_2002/Ts3-6/TS3_6_pluijmers.pdf)).

* A report by the Computer and Communications Industry Association identifies a value of $4.7 trillion and $2.2 trillion in value added from fair use exceptions to US copyright law to the US economy. It employed more than 17 million people and supported a payroll of $1.2 trillion in 2007. Fair use companies generated $281 billion in exports the same year ([Rogers, Szamosszegi, Capital Trade, 2010](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/04/fairuseeconomy.pdf)).
    
* Economic modelling show that nations would enjoy savings from switching to Open Access at both national and institutional levels: £400 million a year for the UK and £500,000-600,000 per annum for a typical UK university ([Houghton, Rasmussen and Sheehan et al, 2009](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/documents/economicpublishingmodelsfinalreport.aspx); [Swan, 2010](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/268584/)).


* A 1% to 10% increase in OA would have a recurring annual gain on the rate of return on R&D of 25% to 75% for all OECD countries ([Houghton and Sheehan, 2006](https://www.vu.edu.au/sites/default/files/wp23_2006_cses.pdf)).

* The Human Genome Project, based on the Bermuda OA Principles, has led to advanced personalized medicine and generated $141 in economic activity for every $1 invested by the U.S. government in the project.  The total related economic activity amounted to $796 billion between 1988 and 2010 ([Wilson and Nicholls, 2015](https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S58728); [Tripp and Grueber, 2011](https://www.genome.gov/27544383/calculating-the-economic-impact-of-the-human-genome-project/)).
