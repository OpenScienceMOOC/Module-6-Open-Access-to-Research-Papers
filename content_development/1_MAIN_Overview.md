Welcome to **Module 6** of the [**Open Science MOOC**](https://eliademy.com/opensciencemooc). This course is totally **SELF-PACED**, meaning it can be completed whenever you want and in your own time.

**Rationale:** Making scholarly research articles openly available is easy, legal, and has demonstrable benefits to authors. This makes it a good beginning step for a researcher just beginning to explore the open world. There is a set of knowledge required to navigate the Open Access landscape, involving copyright, article status, repositories, and economics. This module will introduce key concepts and tools that can help a researcher make their work openly available and maximize the benefits to themselves and others.

**Learning outcomes**

* You will become familiar with the history of scholarly publishing, and development of the present Open Access landscape.

* You will gain a multi-stakeholder insight into Open Access, and be able to convey a balanced overview of the perceived advantages and disadvantages associated with Open Access publishing.

* You will be able to describe some of the complexities of the current the Open Access landscape, including allowances for self-archiving and embargoes, copyright transfer, and publishing contracts.

* Based on community-specific practices, you will be able to use the different types of outlets (repositories) available for self-archiving, as well as the range of Open Access journal types available to you.

* You will able to make all of your own research papers Open Access through a combination of journals and development of a personal self-archiving protocol.

* You will be able to describe the current ebb and flow in the debates around preprints, and be able to locate and use relevant disciplinary preprint platforms.
    
* You will be able to use services like ImpactStory to track the proportion of your research that is Open Access.
