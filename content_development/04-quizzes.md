## Questions

### 1. Open Science is primarily occupied with liberating the (Natural) Sciences (e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Biology, etc.), true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** No, Open Science tries to encompass all scientific activity. For a broader outline of what we at OpenScienceMOOC think Open Science should be, see our first Module on Open Principles (https://eliademy.com/catalog/oer/module-1-open-principles.html)

### 2. Open Access articles are not peer reviewed, true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** Yup, that's a common misconception. Open Access articles undergo the same rigorous peer review as articles published via the traditional subscription-based publishing model.

### 3. Unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction of Open Access articles licensed under CC-BY is permitted only when you:

- [ ] ... have asked the author(s)
- [X] ... have attributed the author(s)
- [ ] ... are also publishing Open Access
- [ ] ... you do not need to do anything

**Answer:** The author(s) must be properly attributed if you wish to use, distribute or reproduce their article. Attribution in this case is simply the common scholarly practice of citation.

### 4. Open Access and open peer review are the same thing, true or false?

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** Open Access journals may use any of the different peer review models, including single-blind, double-blind, open or post-publication peer review. We will learn more about this in the module on Open Evaluation!

### 10. Nobody reads Open Access articles!

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** In fact, a huge number of research has shown that there is a readership, sharing, and citation advantage if you publish your work Open Access!

### 11. I have to pay a lot of money to make my own work Open Access

- [ ] True
- [X] False

**Answer:** While many journals do charge high costs to publish Open Access, they almost always allow some sort of free self-archiving of the accepted, peer review manuscripts. This is often termed 'green Open Access', and varies depending on publisher or journal. According to the Directory of Open Access Journals, there is also a huge variety of journals that are Open Access and do now charge authors to publish  ´- around 12,000 journals! There is almost always a free ot low cost option for authors that does not compromise your choice of venue to publish in. They key point is that there is not a single business model for Open Access.
