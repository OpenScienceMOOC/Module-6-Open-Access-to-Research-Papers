## Painting a global picture of Open Access <a name="global"></a>

Open Access is everywhere, in virtually every country around the world. Even [UNESCO]() have an Open Access policy, quoting:

> Equal access to science is not only a social and ethical requirement for human development, but also essential for realizing the full potential of scientific communities worldwide and for orienting scientific progress towards meeting the needs of humankind.‚Äù (The World Conference on Science, 1999, held under the auspices of UNESCO and ICSU)

While the overall state of the scholarly publishing industry is dominated by major western publishing houses, there are a number of high-level international collaborations that challenge this oligopolistic landscape.

For example:

* **SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online)**: A comprehensive approach to full open access journal publishing, involving a number of Latin American countries.

* **Bioline International**: A non-profit organization dedicated to helping publishers in developing countries is a collaboration of people in the UK, Canada, and Brazil.

* **RePEC (Research Papers in Economics)**: A collaborative effort of over 100 volunteers in 45 countries.

* **Public Knowledge Project**: Developed the open-source publishing software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which is now in use around the world

* [**African Journals Online (AJOL)**](https://www.ajol.info/): AJOL partners with hundreds of journals from all over the African continent, so that African-origin research output is available to Africans and to the rest of the world. 

* [**REDALYC**](http://www.redalyc.org/home.oa): A bibliographic database and a digital library of OA journals, supported by the Universidad Aut?noma del Estado de M?xico with the help of numerous other higher education institutions and information systems.

* [**LA Referencia**](http://www.lareferencia.info/en/): A platform that gives visibility to the scientific production of higher education and research institutions in Latin America, promotes open and free access to the full text, with special emphasis on publicly financed results.
